        What happens when you add a shiny new browser to a stack of already-disagreeing citizens? Youâ€™ll inevitably
        find some bugs. This is the story of how we found a rendering quirk and how the Atlassian frontend team
        found and refined the fix. The Problem The Atlassian User Interface (AUI) library has just finished an IE10
        sprint to get our library prepped and ready for the newest member of the browser family. While IE10 seems
        generally quite good, we found a couple of problems due to IE10 dropping conditional comments; plus some
        undesirable behaviours.
